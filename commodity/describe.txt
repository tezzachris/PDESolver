In this work we propose an extension of the number of factors of existing commodity valuation models while taking into account the issue of the market incompleteness characterizing these markets. Our paper is motivated by the work of Sch√∂ne and Spinler [2] which proposed a four- factor maximal affine stochastic volatility model that did not include stochastic interest rates. The model we develop accounts for several facts characterizing commodity prices and is tested empirically on both futures and options data. The valuation of the contingent claims we adopt is based on the instantaneous Sharpe Ratio approach of Bayraktar et al. [3]. The probabilistic numerical scheme we use (for pricing) to solve the resulting PDEs is the one proposed by J. Zhuo et al [4]. The empirical results show significant fit improvements for the pricing of futures and options.
